Society advanced and civilizations grew to make laws and rules. No made man rule is perfect, for complete foresight is impossible.
Yet failure for subjects to follow rules will lead to chaos, further entropic the more they disobey.

As such, what happens in a place where rules are not even mere suggestions but just words to be ignored? Falling further into disarray and displeasure, no system run on corruption and bribery could prosper but for the corrupt, and even then it will come crumbling down eventually.

Decades old Infrastructure born defected yet standing a grotesque pillar of society, the spawn of savagery can serve no one to supply health. Every 5 years a new bucket of paint, every other year new cracks unfilled. The bridges, the roads, the buildings, the homes, they all suffer and the suffering builds.

Resentment grows, resentment suppressed, the poor hold no power, yet it's still reduced. No. They do have power. The weak, the poor, the common man does have power. Every man, woman, and child can have their voice heard. Peaceful protest is your right, but it's not enough. Chants and Slogans can only do so much. 

What we need is something drastic, like a civil war. Something that can rework the mess made by the false idols we so praise. We need people to fight against the detestable scum at the top, not be its underlings.
